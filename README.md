This work divided into these following sub parts :

 - Age and Gender Detection : For detecting Age & Gender,the attributes are detected using Face API.
 
 - Genre Detection through Emotion Analysis : The emotions are identified using Emotion API. The image is taken
as input and confidence across a set of emotions is returned. These emotions are used to train the neural network
for detecting Genre and RPROP supervised algorithm & ENCOG framework for training purpose.

- Sentiment Analysis of Review : Sentiment analyzer calculated all positive, negative and neutral weights of text
review. For evaluating review rating in numeric form proposed Review Rating Estimation Algorithm. To get
optimum rating,considered User star rating also.
